CRAssist – Class Representative Assistance System

🚀 Project Overview

CRAssist is a role-based web application integrated with the college's student information system, designed to streamline communication, task coordination, feedback collection, and notifications among students, teachers, and administrators. The system automates class representative duties to enhance classroom efficiency and engagement, providing a seamless experience for all users involved.

This project will implement a full DevOps pipeline for Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD), containerized deployments, secure secrets management, real-time monitoring, and a scalable infrastructure using Kubernetes.

✨ Key Features

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated code integration and deployment.

Containerization: Docker containers for easy and consistent application deployment.

Kubernetes: Orchestrates and manages containers at scale.

Monitoring: Real-time system monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

Security: Uses Vault for secrets management and AWS IAM for access control.

Scalable Infrastructure: Fully scalable using Kubernetes, ensuring high availability.
